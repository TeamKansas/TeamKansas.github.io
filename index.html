            <h3>About Me...</h3>
            <p >Hi there! My name is Micah.<br> I am currently in the 11th grade, and I enjoy computer programming, rock-climbing, hiking, and mathematics. I spend most of my free time rock-climbing or writing some computer program.</p>
            <p >I participate in climbing competitions sanctioned by <a href="https://usaclimbing.org">USA Climbing</a>, but I live in Kansas so I do not climb on real rocks very often.</p>

            <h3  style="text-underline-position: under;">My Programming career in a nutshell</h3>
            <ul >
                <li>5th grade: starting programming with Python</li>
                <li>7th grade: made a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot Set</a> viewer with Python</li>
                <li>8th grade: Switched to C, made a bigger, faster Mandelbrot Set viewer using GLUT framework</li>
                <li>9th grade: made a maze generator, Tetris, Snake, and Minesweeper with GLUT</li>
                <li>10th grade: GLUT no longer supported, made tiffDrawingTools to draw to uncompressed TIFF files</li>
                <li>10th grade: made random terrain map generator, maze generator</li>
                <li>10th grade: made program that finds "interesting" spots on the Mandelbrot Set</li>
                <li>10th grade: made command-line Tetris, Snake, Minesweeper, and Wordle, prime number program</li>
                <li>10th grade: learned javascript and html, made even better interactive Mandelbrot set viewer</li>
                <li>Summer before 11th grade: made 2d <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system?scrlybrkr=62cb9bb7">L-System</a> generator</li>
                <li>11th grade: started learning about neural networks</li>
            </ul>
            <p >I learned Python and C from some books, and I learned html and javascript from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML">MDN Web docs</a></p>
            <p >Note: I left out many programming projects that I have worked on over the years, as they were less interesting or less successful. It is important to note that these failures were crucial to helping me become a better programmer. I still have a lot to learn when it comes to algorithms and program flow, but I'm getting there.</p>
