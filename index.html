        <h3>About Me...</h3>
        <p>Hi there! My real name is Micah, and as you may have guessed, I am from the state of Kansas. 
          I find enjoyment in computer science, math, physics, rock climbing, and the great outdoors! 
          Most of my free time consists of writing some sort of computer program or rock climbing.
          I also compete at climbing competitions sanctioned by USA Climbing.</p>

        <h3>My Programming career in a nutshell</h3>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>5th grade: starting programming with Python</li>
            <li>7th grade: made a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot Set</a> viewer with Python</li>
            <li>8th grade: Switched to C, made a bigger, faster Mandelbrot Set viewer using GLUT framework</li>
            <li>9th grade: made a maze generator, Tetris, Snake, and Minesweeper with GLUT</li>
            <li>10th grade: GLUT no longer supported, made tiffDrawingTools to draw to uncompressed TIFF files</li>
            <li>10th grade: made random terrain map generator, maze generator</li>
            <li>10th grade: made program that finds "interesting" spots on the Mandelbrot Set</li>
            <li>10th grade: made command-line Tetris, Snake, Minesweeper, and Wordle, prime number program</li>
            <li>10th grade: learned javascript and html, made even better interactive Mandelbrot set viewer</li>
            <li>Summer before 11th grade: made 2d <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system?scrlybrkr=62cb9bb7">L-System</a> generator</li>
            <li>11th grade: started learning about neural networks</li>
        </ul>
        <p >I learned Python and C from some books, and I learned html and javascript from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML">MDN Web docs</a></p>
        <p>All of the programs I have made have been independent projects without the use of anyone else's code. I have recreated other people's basic ideas in my code, but the implementation is all my creation.</p>
        <p >Note: I left out many programming projects that I have worked on over the years, as they were less interesting or less successful. It is important to note that these failures were crucial to helping me become a better programmer. I still have a lot to learn when it comes to algorithms and program flow, but I'm getting there.</p>

        <p style="">These pictures are snapshots of different programs I have made. Some of them are the direct output made by the program.</p>
